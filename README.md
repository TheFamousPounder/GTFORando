# GTFORando
A web based randomizer for the game GTFO by 10 Chambers. Not many choices right now, will improve, just wanted visuals instead of text. 

TODO:

Add toggles for Cosmetics.

Make unique randomization toggles. Ideas so far: force reroll. filter rundown by Main, Sec, Overload or PE. Adding a page where four loadout randomization are done at once, for use with friends or bot loadouts.

Fix up UI issues

Thank you to Sg5654 for optimizing 

(also the entirety of stack overflow because i'm stupid)
